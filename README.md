# MyPlasm-CNC-Parameters
These parameter files have been generated from .tools files found online. I cannot confirm their completeness or accuracy. All have the transit height set to 25mm or 1". All have the Cut Speed 2 set to 60% of the feed rate extracted from the .tools file. Some .tools files didn't contain a THC Voltage so it has been set to 0 to enable Auto THC.

File PM45XP came from https://forum.langmuirsystems.com/t/download-sheetcam-tool-set-powermax-45-xp/8402

HT45, HT65, HT105, FineCuts and 45-105 came from https://www.candcnc.net/downloads/. 45-105 is all the results of HT45, HT65, HT105, FineCuts combined.

45XP, PMX85, PMX105, PMX125 came from https://www.cncplasmacutters.com.au/knowledge-base/sheetcam-recommended-settings/.

There is minimal difference between Metric and Imperial other than the kerf width in the file description has been converted and the cut height is 25mm and 1" respectively. MyPlasm stores all parameter files as metric and converts them within the program.
